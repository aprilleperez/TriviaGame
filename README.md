# TriviaGame

# Description
I chose the harder trivia game option, which displays one question at a time for only 15 seconds. When the answer is correct/wrong, or when timer is up, an appropriate message pops up for only 3 seconds, and the game moves on to the next question. 

# Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery

# Composition
Start page (title, instruction, start button), Game page (image, 15-sec timer, question, 4 buttons with options), message prompts (appropriate message for correct/wrong/out of time conditions), End page (Total score out of 5 questions, play again button)

# Takeaways
Taking on the harder option of the hw assignments can be very overwhelming when I don't have a strong grasp of thinking through the logic. This assignment took a 180º in terms of how I felt during the process, compared to the previous Unit-4 assignment. Again, I learned the importance of writing out my thoughts in English (what I want to happen, comprehensive steps necessary in the game), as well as reaching out to my peers and using all my resources. It was extra difficult this time around (compared to the Word Guess Game where I also chose the hard verison) since I was sick throughout all of this assignment. So if anything, this assignment also showed me both code and real world obstacles that I could encounter on any given task. Juggling between the syntaxes of Javascript and jQuery and keeping track of the logic I am coding was very difficult, so I still have to master taking each step one at a time. I almost pivoted and switched to the easier version, but I kept with my code a bit longer. I am proud to say that I finished with the basic, fully functioning game and the payoff was worth it! I learned that I am still learning, and that stumbling along the way is part of the learning. 

# Feedback
My process is all commented in the code, but I would like some focused help on trying to condense code to avoid clunkiness/repition. I would also want some feedack on how I could have thought through this assignment, since I didn't have a strong grasp on how it should work before I coded it (I tried, but my thought process jumped around throughout the coding portion).
