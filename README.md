# Avatar: The Last Trivia Game – A trivia/timeout game

## Description
I chose the harder trivia game option, which displays one question at a time for only 15 seconds. When the answer is correct/wrong, or when timer is up, an appropriate message pops up for only 3 seconds, and the game moves on to the next question. 

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery

## Composition
Start page (title, instruction, start button), Game page (image, 15-sec timer, question, 4 buttons with options), message prompts (appropriate message for correct/wrong/out of time conditions), End page (Total score out of 5 questions, play again button)
